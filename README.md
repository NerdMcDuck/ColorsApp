# ColorsApp
This is my first Android App, so through this app, I'll be exploring different aspects of Android development. 
My main goal for this app is to learn the "ins and outs" of Android development through research and through the official Android documentation. 
For this project, I went with Java because it is what I know best. 

I want to enventually convert it to a Kotlin application but first I need to learn Kotlin. I figured that it is best to learn and understand the basic of Android development first and foremost to then learn and convert to a Kotlin application.
